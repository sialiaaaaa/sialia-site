# _Vizier's Penny Dreadful_

## Introduction

This is an unedited, unexplained collection of notes on my 5th edition _Dungeons & Dragons_ campaign that ran from 2020 to 2023. A summary from one of my <strong class="koraki">someone</strong> is available elsewhere on this site, and perhaps eventually I'll do a nicer write-up of the story. For now, I'll just archive some of the worldbuilding and cosmology for posterity. Enjoy!

## Encounters

### Two Doors

Two tiny doors are set into the wall. In front of each is a gnome: one with a blue hat, and one with a red hat. The blue-hatted gnome hands the characters a note:

_One guard always tells the truth. The other is trying to eat you. This isn't a puzzle. Run._

The red-hatted gnome is a redcap (_Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse_ page 208) and attacks immediately.

## Magic items

These are pretty weird.

### of the Magnanimous Mister Mathers

#### Ring of Invisibility

_Wondrous item, common_

This unadorned silver ring turns invisible when donned.

### not of the Magnanimous Mister Mathers

#### Overtuned Forks

_Wondrous item, legendary_

This set of sixteen tuning forks vibrates slightly with cosmic energy. Each is tuned to a different note, corresponding with the sixteen Outer Planes. A small symbol is engraved at the base of each fork, representing its attuned plane. By striking a fork, each creature within 15 feet that can hear the ringing is transported to a random location on that fork's corresponding plane. The creatures remain there only as long as the fork is ringing, though they do not need to be able to hear it. When the fork stops ringing, all creatures transported by it return to their original positions. A fork rings for 1d20 hours. While one fork is ringing, the box closes and cannot be opened, meaning a fork cannot be stopped from ringing early nor two rung at the same time.

## Cosmology

I was serious about presenting these without comment. I apologise for what must look like utterly mad ravings. They are.

### Pantheon

**Hastur** _Who governs the unknown and the unknowable, the end, darkness, and death of knowledge_ Alignment: Neutral Evil Colour: Yellow Counterpart: Vizier Symbol: Eye

**Vizier** _Who governs knowledge and its giving, safeguards the library, and knows all_ Alignment: Neutral Good Colour: Blue Counterpart: Hastur Symbol: Spectacles

**Death** _Who governs the death of mortals, shepherds them beyond, and provides a final companionship at the end_ Alignment: Chaotic Evil Colour: Black Counterpart: None Symbol: Scythe

**Godmaker** _Who governs and gives rise to the immortals, and commands their fate_ Alignment: Lawful Good Colour: Green Counterpart: Velka Symbol: Stone

**Velka** _Who governs the end of immortals, authored the rules of their demise, and takes them into the beyond_ Alignment: Lawful Evil Colour: Purple Counterpart: Godmaker Symbol: Crow Feather

END = The end, death, obfuscation, recession, and absence of...

SEER = Watches and never interferes in the affairs of...

BEGINNING = The beginning, life, spreading, growth, and presence of...

  

F = Father (he/him), the great monolith. A single immeasurably large black stone adrift in the Far Realm. One half of the Parents that spawned the Rogues. Also the Neutral Evil Sister.

M = Mother (she/her), the myriad. Her main body is adrift in the Far Realm, but almost every aberration is an extension of it. The other Parent. Also the Neutral Good Sister.

  

Ve = Velka (she/her), the Crow. The Lawful Evil Sister. Governs the END of immortals.

H = Hastur (he/him), the First Eye. The Neutral Evil Sister. Governs the END of knowledge.

D = Death (he/him), the Shepherd. The Chaotic Evil Sister. Governs the END of mortals.

F = Father (see above). SEER to immortals..

M = Mother (see above). SEER to mortals.

G = Godmaker (it), the Debris. The Lawful Good Sister. Governs the BEGINNING of immortals. Spawned the Gods.

Vi = Vizier (they/them), the All-Knowing. The Neutral Good Sister. Governs the BEGINNING of knowledge.

There is no True Neutral (SEER of knowledge) or Lawful Good (BEGINNING of mortals) Sister.

  

There are innumerable and ever-more Gods, spawned from Godmaker, who are ruled by the 26 members of the High Pantheon. They come in Good and Evil pairs. Typically spawn everything below them. They are listed separately.

  

There are innumerable and ever-more Arch-Beings. These include, but are not limited to, the Arch-Devils, -Demons, and -Angels. The Nine of Baator, the Seven Angels, and the Three Below rule these.

  

There are innumerable and ever-more other immortals, such as liches or tardigrades.

  

Many of the High Pantheon actually hold multiple seats, such as Dionysus being both the Good God of Folly and of Chaos.
