# a magic system

Combining 5th edition _Dungeons & Dragons_' schools of magic, some older editions' ideas about divinity, and my obsession with organisation, I've produced this. May it serve you well!

## Categorisation

Magic is broadly organised by what processes it has undergone. A 'spell' is still technically formed of the same arcane energy as any other spell, but the way it's expressed is what determines what 'kind' of magic it is.

### "Arcane" vs. "divine"

These are the two broadest categories of magic. _Arcane_ magic comes directly from the stars, is bounced off a caster, and expressed directly. Wizards are arcane casters, and magic produced from magic items is arcane as well. It has, at most, been stored or channeled through an object. It hasn't been meaningfully altered by the media it's passed through. _Divine_ magic comes 'from' something. For example, a warlock granted their powers by a devil is always casting divine magic, since the devil channels the magic directly to them. Importantly, the caster is a valid candidate for an intervener when deciding if magic is arcane or divine. A sorcerer whose soul is a font of draconic magic is still casting divine magic, in technical terms. A druid, casting spells by pulling energy from the nature around them, is casting divine magic.

### Divine subdivisions

Divine magic is further divided into _internal_ and _external_ magic; the former being magic brought forth from oneself, and the latter being magic granted by a _deity_[^1]. _Psionics_ (focused energy of the mind), _metamagic_ (alteration of arcane magic through force of will), _spiritualism_ (empathy given form, channeled through nature), and _ki_ (energy of the physical body) are examples of internal divine magic.

External magic is divided into the _true_ and _false_ categories. True external magic is granted by an 'actual' deity, while false external magic is granted from any lesser immortal.

### Arcane subdivisions

Arcane magic is divided into 'invented' forms, called _dunamancy_, and 'natural' forms, called _pure_ arcane magic. These are divided into 'schools' (though divine magic is often categorised into the same schools based on its effects).

Schools of dunamancy include _graviturgy_ (manipulation of gravity), _chronomancy_ (time), _hydromancy_ (the sea), and _bladesong_ (a certain elvish technique). The pure schools are _abjuration_ (protective), _conjuration_ (transporting), _divination_ (revealing), _enchantment_ (affecting the mind and body), _evocation_ (manifesting effects), _illusion_ (deceiving), and _necromancy_ (manipulating life).
