## About
*Myself*— I am Lucy, linguistics student specialising in semantics and general doer of other things. I write a lot of stories and rules. Some of the things I've written are here! I can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/sialiaaaaa) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucy-winters/) and emailed directly at lucy @ this domain.

*Others*— This website's theming takes inspiration from Chris DeLuca's [Base CSS to Style a Novel](https://www.chrisdeluca.me/2022/01/26/base-css-to.html) and the theming of [Georg Duffner's open source EB Garamond](http://www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond/index.html), which is also this site's preferred font. The colour scheme used for code blocks is [Catppuccin Frappé](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin/). The site is hosted with [The Tardis Project](https://tardisproject.uk/). I recommend the works and website of [Cosmo](https://cosmo.tardis.ac/).
