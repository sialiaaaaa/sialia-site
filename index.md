[Garden Game](/content/GardenGame.ulx) (608.8 KB ULX) The demo for my work-in-progress interactive fiction game. Play with the link or a downloaded copy in any IF interpreter (I suggest [[iplayif.com/|Parchment]]).

[[content/freebird-adventure-log|Freebird's Adventure Log]] The very long, very comprehensive log of a certain corvid's time dreaming.

[*The Montonet Curse*](/content/The_Montonet_Curse_V0.9.pdf) (26.07 MB PDF) A short 5th edition *Dungeons & Dragons* adventure that is still, years later, not fully revised. Features some abstract AI art, from back when AI art was just strange and evocative.
