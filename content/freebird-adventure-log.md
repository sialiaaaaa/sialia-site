the party awakens in a jail cell, in what they would later find out is the feywilds. as they begin to catch up on thir adventures, the court messenger of the magnanimous mister mathers approaches. he explains that he has seized the dragon eggs which david and aaaron held with them but lost while travelling with the blue veil, and will return them if the party completes the magnificent maze of the magnanimous mister mathers. he lets them out and vanishes. aaaron fails to jump the walls. the court messenger mentions a time limit. the party continues to a fork. the debate begins anew. ryu points out that they know nothing, so either direction is just as good, as long as david's in from the eat the paths. aaaron draws the hierophant of things, which says things once, quietly. everyone goes left, where they run across a door in a trippy hallway. there's a fucking egg in the way. an arm from the wall points at the egg. david pokes the egg. aaaron shoots the egg. david tries to go past the egg, but the door is too bouncy. freebird dodges the egg's leg and sticks an arm into it. ryu cleaves through the egg, causing it distress. david attacks the egg right in the clamshells. the egg glues itself to the door and wants death. ryu grants its wish. the door disappears.

past it is a courtyard with the eggs and an object covered in cloth. freebird removes the cloth, under which is a medusa. aaaron recovers it, allowing freebird to resist the petrification. the eggs are fakes made of stone. aaaron tries to call gade, but the court messenger doesn't let him. the maze continues with a split. the party goes right and david chops through a door leading into a study. inside, a dead cabbage is caged upon a piano. a note instructs the party to play dead as a caged cabbage. freebird plays DEADCAGEDCABBAGE on the piano, solving the puzzle. aaaron demonstrates his newlyfound clerical abilities by identifying ryu's cursed armour. the maze loops back around to the same fork as earlier. the party turns left and enters a courtyard identical to the one from earlier. freebird uncovers the object which is, again, a medusa. freebird instantly turns to stone. aaaron fails to recover the medusa, and david looks at it, but doesn't turn to stone. he recovers it correctly. the court messenger agrees to unpetrify freebird if the maze is completed in one percent of the time limit. david grabs freebird. the remaining party comes across a door, which speaks to them in a southern accent. it tells them to speak mellon and enter. ryu and aaaron wheedle the door into saying the word "friend", but are unsuccesful until aaaron casts command.

behind the door is another courtyard, similar to the first two but with a chest instead of a covered object and eggs. david opens the chest, which is a mimic and attacks him. ryu calls forth the forces of hell to destroy the mimic. the next room is another courtyard, identical to the first two. david removes the covering of the object, and beholds the slightly less ugly visage of the court messenger. he allows them to choose between depetrifying freebird or getting a marvelous magical machine, which of course instigates another round of debate. david decides to have freebird depetrified, which leaves a freebird statue behind. aaaron claims that because the statue is still there, freebird was not depetrified, so he is owed the machine. the court messenger tells aaaron that he can get the machine if he goes through the maze backwards, and that the eggs in the second courtyard, which nobody bothered to check, were the real ones. aaaron and david set off. aaaron sets the talking door from before on fire to get through it, which of course kills it. freebird asks the court messenger questions as they wait, but gets obstinance in return. as david returns through the egg hallway, the arm tries to grab him, but fails. at the beginning of the maze, aaaron finds a golden pocketwatch-like object. freebird loses their patience and stabs the court messenger, who retaliates with fey magic, but freebird dodges. david and aaaron return with the eggs and machine. aaaron opens the machine, in which there is a needle that can point to one of sixteen symbols, which represent the planes. when the needle points to a plane and a button is pressed, a voice tells the weather in that plane. as the court messenger readies to teleport the party to the magnanimous mister mathers himself, a restraining order suddenly activates and sends the party somewhere completely different.

## Chapter 15: So Beautiful, Your Head Might Explode

the party appears before titania in her court, and she introduces herself. she explains that the magnanimous mister mathers, formerly known as oberon, is her ex, and she has a restraining order to stop him from operating in the feywilds. as she talks, a noble informs her that mister mathers is attacking the seelie court. titania asks the party's help in fending off the attack. just then, david's egg begins to hatch. titania immediately assumes the party are mathers' spies, and traps them in a cage while she goes to fight. out of the egg comes what is assumed to be a young black dragon. david feeds it dead bats. the fighting comes into the hall, with titania struggling against a metric truckload of red-hatted gnomes. ryu convinces her to let the party help. david kills scores of gnomes with his greataxe. the baby dragon tears through and eats gnomes. ryu kills even more gnomes. freebird casts shatter in the middle of the gnome horde. the horde of gnomes is soon routed. all of the dead gnomes disappear simultaneously in a blinding flash. titania thanks the party and refuses to parley with mathers. the other egg begins to hatch. aaaron and freebird get titania to teleport it to limbo before it can. the party debates on where to go next, and what to do with the baby dragon. they decide the baby dragon hasn't done anything worthy of murder yet, and to keep it around. titania forces silence upon everyone, but aaaron draws the maroon 5 of things, which sings 'things'. enraged, titania seizes and destroys the deck of many things. she offers the party one boon, and one minute to decide which. at the end of the minute before anyone can react aaaron asks to be sent to mechanus before anyone can stop him. ryu also asks for a lock of her hair, which she gives before sending everyone to mechanus.

## Chapter 16: Death Clock

the party appears on a giant bronze cog in mechanus. david, terribly angered by aaaron forcing him to mechanus, attacks him. a pentadrone modron appears and demands an identification code, scaring freebird into turning invisible, but aaaron reads one from one of his stolen death clocks, appeasing the modron. david and freebird realize they have to keep aaaron alive to keep themselves alive. aaaron tells them about the underground railroad and begins to lead them to it. as they move over the cogs towards a distant pyramid, they are accosted by a cluster of duodrone modrons. although aaaron reads them the identification code, the modrons have a kill order registered for it and attack. they whack david, who fails to retaliate. freebird sneak stabs one, killing it instantly. aaaron and david work to de-limb the other two, leaving them helpless. aaaron tries and fails to disassemble one, but freebird makes a more successful attempt, removing a modron's death clock. aaaron leads the party off again, and they reach the pyramid. freebird stares into the void below until aaaron explains that foreigners are frequently dropped into it. the group enters the pyramid, and aaaron jumps up to a higher platform, letting a rope down to let the others also climb up. he meets a rogue modron that helped him on the underground railroad. the rogue leads the party to the part of the underground railroad aaaron knows.

with aaaron's guidance, the party navigates some vents and falls into a room with many inactive modrons. the party rests briefly, and david begins to run perilously low on bats. aaaron guides the party into a chute. at the bottom, they meet a dwarf who gave aaaron a key previously. aaaron returns the key to him and the party goes into yet another tunnel and into a cell. freebird locks the already unlocked door and then picks the lock. the party sneaks through the jail. along the way, freebird tries to feed the dragon, which aaaron names doog, a modron corpse, but doog refuses it. the party finds the kitchen, where bread-like substances are being produced. a blind robot in the center of the kitchen instructs the party to get on a conveyor belt in order to escape through "some magic." she also reads, somehow. freebird plans to leave doog there, but aaaron tells him in draconic to follow them. the party gets on the conveyer, and are transported to a drop, where they teleport to a place selected by aaaron's thoughts.

## Chapter 17: The Way of the Northern Reaches

aaaron was thinking of his monastery, so the party appears on a snowy mountain in the material plane. doog follows. the bitter cold quickly tires aaaron and freebird. atop the mountain is a monastery, which everyone heads for. aaaron wraps himself in his bedroll. freebird creates a small flame with magic. time passes, and aaaron ends up even worse off. a snowstorm begins to set in, blinding everyone, and aaaron grows horribly cold and starts to lag behind. as ryu, freebird, and david see a light, aaaron can walk no more and begins to crawl, before collapsing entirely. the light resolves itself to three monks, who give the group warm clothing. they rescue aaaron as he wavers on death's doorstep, and take everyone to the monastery. as freebird and aaaron sleep of the cold, the monks offer to let the group stay. freebird wakes after ten hours, and finds out that the group is very far from the sword coast. the monks explain that aaaron should stay inside for a week, and that doog can hunt for food around. over the next few days, freebird researches, mostly into the monastry itself, and learns draconic from ryu, and david and doog go exploring around the mountain. after three days, thorne wakes, and is reunited with the others, who forgive him for sending them to mechanus after his near death. the party plans to travel to elturel for the purposes of research and claiming leosin's rewards after aaaron recovers.

just then, a parcel containing a deck of many things arrives from titania, to apologise for the brief imprisonment and as a replacement for the destroyed one. aaaron immediately draws balance from it, making him lawful. he also uses his clerical magic to identify the potions that freebird stole as a potion of clairvoyance and a potion of invisibility. ryu's pit fiend compels ryu to draw a card from the deck of many things. he draws the throne, giving him ownership of a small keep. aaaron identifies the deck of many things as a real deck of many things. freebird draws the moon, giving them the ability to cast wish twice. david confiscates the deck. aaaron announces that he wants to draw another card, and then falls asleep from exhaustion. he draws key in his sleep, summoning a magical sickle. the next day, freebird struggles to talk to doog. david, while out hunting with doog, draws the fool, which causes him to draw two more cards. they are the gem, which gives him exceedingly valuable jewelry, and the jester, which gives him a level up. freebird puts the deck of many things in the bag of holding so that nobody can draw without removing it.

the day after, a blizzard sets in, and freebird and aaaron perform a magic ritual to revert aaaron back to chaotic. two days later, the blizzard still shows no sign of relenting, and freebird decides to try and use an obelisk on the mountain's peak they learned of during their research to calm the weather. so that aaaron is not re-exposed, david volunteers to carry freebird up in the bag of holding. david and freebird bundle up to leave, but the instant freebird opens the bag of holding to get in, aaaron declares that he will draw three cards from the bag of holding. david sets off toward the mountaintop. freebird warms the inside of the bag with magic. david fights off the cold and reaches the obelisk, which creates a bubble of warmth. freebird gets out and investigates the obelisk, but before david can help, a yeti attacks. freebird sits and begins to meditate, exposing himself to the elements, as david clashes with the yeti. freebird's meditation reaches a zenith, removing the warmth bubble entirely. with the storm about him, david slays the yeti. freebird releases the obelisk's power and calms the storm, which shatters the obelisk. they and david descend back to the monastery. the instant they open the door, aaaron drinks his chaos soup. one of the three cards he had drawn was balance (the others were vizier and comet), and he drank the chaos to become chaotic again. it works, but also instantaneously kills him. suddenly, abyssal tendrils appear and knock everyone out.

## Chapter 18: It's Almost Like the Plot is Moving Now

the party and doog i guess wake up in the abyss, where the chained goddess, noctis, speaks to them. she asks them to get revenge on the gods for her by killing them, under pain of eternal torture. to assist them in this matter, she gives everyone the last level up they'd get for six friggin months. she also makes the marvelous forecast machine a planar travel device, which transports people when they sleep like a blue veil. finally, she gives the party a length of chain, to bind the gods' eternal forms after their avatars are slain. aaaron calls gade, and seems generally unconcerned. noctis lists the gods she wants slain. she also mentions that a new god was just created. david asks if it's the dragon that was sent to limbo. it's the dragon that was sent to limbo. then she returns everyone to consciousness, including aaaron. the monks, worried about everyone's sudden unconsciousness, take the party to an onsen. david hates it. freebird and aaaron get towels. the monk leads the party down the mountain, so that they can get to the town of chershire, where they can take a wagon to elturel. aaaron and the monk easily jump down a cliff, but freebird falls. david catches them. freebird, going to draw, notices that two 'mask' cards have been added to the deck of many things. they draws the moon, and get two more wishes. aaaron draws the star, giving him an asi. the monk draws ruin, but because they are a monk with no possesions, nothing happens. at aaaron's persistence, david draws ruin, deleting his entire company, all the treasure he was hoarding, his weapon, and the jewelry from the sun. aaaron gives david a replacement shortsword. the monk leads the gang down another cliff. david carries aaaron down on his back.

at the bottom of the mountain, the monk parts ways with the party. in a forest, aaaron runs off to attack a bear, so that he can get the level up from comet, but loses it. freebird hides in a bush. a man approaches david and aaaron, tells them that he's being attacked by a werebear, and begs for them to take him back to the village. freebird jumps out of the bush and scares him, growling and casting an illusion of a bear. the man bites david. he is, naturally, a werebear. aaaron insists on fighting him alone for the comet, but david retaliates against the werebear anyway. freebird hides in a bush. aaaron vindictively refuses to help david. freebird pokes their head out of a bush, casts a spell, and goes right back to hiding. david hits the werebear but doesn't do much. aaaron continues to do nothing. freebird tries to stab the werebear but also is mostly ineffective. david calls doog in. he and the bear brawl. aaaron, angered by doog being injured, joins the fray. doog's acid and aaaron's magic prove effective against the bear, and it is defeated. aaaron insists on a replacement draw for the comet. he draws the throne. david draws the gem. doog also wants to draw a card, for some reason. he announces his desire to draw, and waits an hour to see what it is.

## Chapter 19α: Dooged Timeline

doog draws the void, which sucks out his soul. aaaron uses his vizier to find out what happened to doog. doog's soul is trapped in the spawning stone in limbo. freebird draws to try and help doog. they draw the euryale, which curses them. aaaron draws as well, and gets talons, which destroys his magic sickle, boots of striding and springing, ring of invisibility, sending stone to gade, and the marvelous machine. he resolves to do anything he can do reverse this, and begins rapidly drawing cards. a knight appears under his service (knight). all of his material possessions disappear (ruin). david returns the shortsword. an avatar of death appears to kill aaaron in single combat (skull). a magic ice whip also manifests (key). aaaron uses it to kill death and keeps drawing. he gets wish spells (moon) before getting his soul sucked out (void) but using wish to undo it. the ice whip vanishes (talons). a magic rainbow robe appears (sun). finally, aaaron draws the fates. he uses freebirds pearl necklace to identify the rainbow robe as a robe of scintillating colours. debate breaks out as to what aaaron should do with the fates, which can undo an event. aaaron chooses to undo doog drawing the void, and time reverses.

## Chapter 19β: Diseases and Cures

doog draws the mask, which seems to do nothing. freebird and aaaron begin to suspect that, because david was bitten by a werebear, he is now infected. making it out of the forest, the party votes to camp overnight there. aaaron discovers that the deck of many things was changed, and now has entirely different cards. he identifies the deck as a deck of illusions. he and freebird conspire to run from david as soon as he is asleep, so that they are far away when he is a werebear. they fake falling asleep, and then book it. david does, in fact, turn into a werebear. he kills and eats ryu, although midi escapes by riding doog. then he chases after freebird and aaaron. aaaron ditches freebird and runs to chershire. david bites freebird, turning them into a werebear as well. freebird the werebear stalls david the werebear until morning. then they turn back to normal and also go to chershire. the townspeople are fearful, because they suspect that they are lycanthropes. thorne finds them. he summons a gnome from the deck of illusions, and then dispels it. a shady townsperson leads the party to a very shady apothecary. the apothecary explains that in order to cure lycanthropy, which is a disease in the blood, he simply has to remove all the blood. he lays david on a surgical table, stabs him with a metal rod, and concludes that he does have lycanthropy. he knocks david out with an anesthetic, i hope, and then slashes his neck. once most of david's blood is gone, he replaces it with some from some blood bags he just... had. with some magical assistance from freebird, david survives the procedure. then it is freebird's turn. with magical assistance from aaaron, freebird survives their procedure as well, although they didn't get any anesthesia.

aaaron puts a little bit of the blood that was drained from the two of them into a vial. then he takes the powdered silver which was supposed to be used in the treatment but wasn't and runs it back up to the monastery, to replace the silver he used to cast the spell to revert his alignment back to chaotic. meanwhile, freebird and david clear out the ghouls from the medical ward with relative ease, although david takes heterosexual damage from fighting while injured. they go to sleep in the medical ward. freebird wakes when their spidey-sense tingles, and sees the strange doctor man reveal his true form as an oni. they rouse david with a screech, and the pair launches an attack, but the oni just regenerates and sends freebird to sleep. david shakes him awake, and slams into the oni until he falls. then he and freebird run past him and out into the street. the oni turns into gas and gives chase. david flees town to search for doog and aaaron while freebird begins to request aid from the townsfolk. they surround and defeat the oni, thank freebird, and tell them to leave. david finds doog. freebird leaves to go find david. david finds aaaron, who has finished replacing the silver. freebird finds david. they return to the town to find midi, and eventually locate her on top of a building. freebird climbs up and chucks her down. the party leaves town again, planning to chase the wagon to elturel on foot, but camps before they get far. secretly, aaaron activates the marvelous machine. everyone sleeps.

## Chapter 20β: Requires Tempura Sour

the party wakes up in limbo. they can't breathe, and they just barely survive the elements until freebird stabilizes an air bubble. david and freebird are, naturally, pretty pissed at aaaron, but they need his stabilization prowess. aaaron notices that the party is directly adjacent to the spawning stone, which noctis had told the party to break in order to defeat the githch. aaaron makes a stone disk for everyone to get on and floats over. freebird tries to use limbo's power to create an axe for david from their illusions, but accidentally creates illusory duplicates of themself. aaaron determines that the spawning stone is the spawning stone, but cannot break it. freebird casts shatter, but the stone is immune. they do successfully make david an axe. the stone continues to prove impervious to attack, until aaaron begins speaking to it in modron. then he casts identify, but the stone resists that, too. aaaron speaks to the stone again, and learns that it is broken. he attaches a death clock to it. then he impersonates primus to log into the rock. freebird summons an assassin from the deck of illusions, but he instantly dies in the soup. aaaron continues to question the stone until it uses up the death clock, but cannot make sense of the answers. he attaches another death clock, and figures out how to cause the stone to self destruct. the party debates over what to do, but cannot figure out a way to destroy the stone and escape before limbo destabilises and kills them. aaaron makes a new flcleiling machine, and the party zooms off in a random direction.

## Chapter 21β: Wild Magic All Night Long

david flings a metal cone. the flcieling machine arrives at a silvery pillar, where two dragonborn and a halfling are stuck. their names are promptly forgotten. they explain that the pillar is a guidon, which can use divination magic to guide one through limbo, and that they were on a boat when something destroyed it, stranding them there. the halfling has been barely able to stabilize enough air for them. freebird makes a hemisphere for them to get on. aaaron identifies the guidon as a guidon, and points out that he can wait eight hours to get divination magic from his deity, but that would destroy the flclieling machine. he talks with the halfling to try and get him to pick a direction. meanwhile. david tries to steal the bag of holding from freebird so he can use the potion of clairvoyance. freebird is displeased and seperates their hemisphere from the flcieling machine. aaaron asks for the halfling to be returned so he can continue talking to them. freebird chucks them towards the flcieling machine, but they instantly die while flying through space. the dragonborn are reasonably upset and attack freebird. freebird flees onto the flcieling machine, destabilizing the hemisphere and nearly killing them both, but the flcieling machine catches them. david also tries to attack freebird, but freebird vanishes. david summons a large pole to try and find the invisibird. aaaron gives the dragonborn medical treatment. freebird reappears, summons up wish, and flips a coin. it's tails. freebird casts ressurection, bringing the halfling back to life.

they also destroy their notebook for symbolism. the dragonborn and halfling debate. freebird uses limbo to make a paper from illusions, accidentally covering themself in silver flames as they do. the halfling convinces the dragonborn to not murder freebird and to stay on the flclieling machine. aaaron gets the halfling to pick a direction, and they're off again. everyone rests while aaaron stays awake to maintain the machine. he spams magic, letting limbo twist it as it will. in the 'morning', he has a rock affixed to his arm, a card from the deck of many things, a lot of money, and absolutely no hair. david hordes the money. freebird draws the card, which is the vizier. they ask it how to get to the nearest town, percival. then they relay those instructions to aaaron. everyone is very hungry. the flclieling machine reaches the remnants of percival, because of course percival was destroyed as well. a gith there takes them in as refugees, and explains that an explosion somehow destroyed the cities across the entire plane. things aren't stabilizing properly anymore either. david tries to explain that the dragon titania sent to limbo may have been responsible, but freebird and aaaron claim his insanity and get everyone sent to the doctor. the doctor tells aaaron to get some rest and heals freebird of a small wound. freebird and david decide to return to the material plane. the doctor gives aaaron a stack of papers when he asks for a blood sample. aaaron falls asleep, and david and freebird put him in the bag of holding. the doctor tells david that doog is not a dragon, but a wyvern, and gives freebird a message to give to a lady named dresden in elturel. then doog, david, and freebird locate the city's still-standing gate back to the material plane and enter. as they travel, they wake up in the abyss, where noctis upbraids them for not killing any gods yet, before they wake up again.

## Intermission 21.5β一: Pretty Elturel, Eh?

the party wakes in a tree in a park in elturel. they jump out of the tree, scaring passersby, and cross the street to a tavern. inside, freebird scares off a posse of dark-hooded men, and david is a bad businessman. aaaron orders way too many meat pies. the party finally gets to eat, and gets directions to their various errands. then they split up, and this time, yours truly actually can tell what everyone did. david and aaaron go through the shopping district. they enter a store of magic items and other trinkets, but all of the magic items are crap. next, they go to a jewelry store to try and sell the jewelry from the gem, but the store is unwilling to pay more than a quarter of its value. then they enter the bank. they get routed to the exchanges desk, then the non-humanoid exchanges desk (because doog is there), and then the non-humanoid valuble material exchanges desk, where the necklaces are evaluated. they are then given a ticket and sent back to the exchanges desk, and then the non-humanoid valuable material exchange reflectiveness, density, mass, and purity ticket credibility officer's desk, and then the credible non-humanoid valuable material exchange reflectiveness, density, mass, and purity ticket processing desk, where they fake a credible non-humanoid valuable material exchange quantity ticket, get doog to sign a non-humanoid valuable material exchange acceptance document, and finally sell half of the jewelry... to doog's account. they go to the withdrawals desk, then the non-humanoid withdrawals desk, then the non humanoid total withdrawals desk, where david finds that a non-humanoid account under his surname exists. first, they make total withdrawal from doog's account, though, which dumps so much money on the two of them that aaaron instantly dies.

## Intermission 21.5β二: Studs and Buttons

meanwhile, freebird has exchanged their leather armour for some studded leather and gone to helm's shieldhall, where the monks, including leosin, were last seen. they enter to find that the monks already left, but a cyclops there has been entrusted with the reward. freebird gives him their report, and finds that the silver raven did not arrive. they get their payment, and ask for his aid in finding the raven before leaving for the local college. there, freebird researches the gods that noctis wanted dead, but doesn't find much. they head to the bank to sell their share of the jewelry from the gem. they go to the exchanges desk, the humanoid exchanges desk, and then are directed to the avian humanoid exchanges desk. freebird takes offense from that, and goes to the complaints department, where they are directed to the humanoid complaints desk. the person there tries to direct freebird to the avian humanoid complaints desk, but freebird points out that that is why they're there. they get sent directly to the manager. fed up with all of this, freebird casts shatter on the manager, who is a mind flayer. in a short but fierce battle, the manager catches freebird and flays their mind, leaving them unconscious.

## Chapter ?γ: The Worst Timeline

at the end of time, freebird and a wizard named casia stand before the dungeon of acererak ii. they enter, seeking to slay acererak and end the world. the door immediately closes behind them. a minion with a magic mouth spell on it speaks nonsense at them until they leave to the left. they enter into a hall of doors. freebird enters one, which teleports them back to the minion. the party proceeds down the hall of doors until they reach a chest with swords hanging above it. the swords are all mimics. inside the chest is a butt that farts. the party flees. they try to go right at the entrance, but are blocked by an invisible wall. they return to the hall of doors, where freebird opens all of the doors until one of them is a mimic. casia shoots it with her rays of frost and freebird with their crossbow until it dies. through the empty doorframe is a tiled corridor, with alternating solid floors and pits. freebird summons an unseen servant, which walks directly over the pit and then falls through the solid floor. they are, naturally, illusions. freebird jumps the solid bit and uses a rope to pull casia across and up. the next pit is a pit, but it's on a corner, so casia easily steps over it. around the corner, a wall is lined with ten sarcophagi. casia opens one, in which are seven apes and a +3 wand of the war mage. casia retreats over the pit. the apes pelt her with rocks, but she casts shield and then pulse wave, pulling them into the pit. then she opens all of the sarcophagi remotely with mage hand, in which are 52 apes and a +3 shortsword. freebird uses an illusion of a banana to lure all of them into the pit, which fills it. casia attunes to the wand while freebird does the same with the shortsword. they are both turned into monkeys.

casimonke and freemonke continue past the sarcophagi to a room with four ghosts playing poker, but freemonke beats them all. the monkeys return to the previous corridor, where a toxic gas is now seeping out of the walls. there are jelly cubes on the floor. freebird shoves their face in one, giving them immunity to the gas, but not before contracting a disease that will kill them in a few days. casia manages to resist the gas. the monkey party returns to the hall of doors, and casia opens the remaining ones until one is a mimic. freebird and casia quickly dispatch of it. they walk into a room full of sand. casia pulls a stopper out, and the sand begins to drain, revealing giant spiders. they start killing them, but the spiders keep emerging. as the last of the sand is drained, freebird casts shatter in the spiders midst, killing all but one. it webs casia, but she kills it with magic. the monkeys rest on the floor before heading through the newly opened hole. the chamber at the bottom is also full of sand. freebird pulls the plug, revealing a chain devil with the key to the door of the chamber taped to his buttcheek. casia casts hypnotic pattern on it, allowing freebird to grab the key and for the two to make their escape.

the next room has seven glass cases with keys and a door with six locks. casia just pours water into the locks and freezes it with magic to break the locks, but the door does not open. suddenly, david shows up, having made it through the rest of the dungeon after casia and freebird somehow. he shatters a case and swallows a key. alarms go off, and a panel in the wall opens up, allowing several goblins to pass through before closing again. freebird and david quickly kill them. david shatters another case, and more goblins come out. casia staves off the goblins before the entire party enters through the panel. beyond it, they find the goblin storage room, and then a fat goblin who offers gauntlets of true invincibility for a butt that farts. freebird farts on him. the goblin removes freebird's monkey butt with a cleaver and gives them the gauntlets. back in the goblin storeroom, david destroys a door, and the party continues into another tiled hallway. the first tile, which david steps on, plays all star. the second casts power word kill on him, killing him instantly. casia walks on david's body over the second tile and steps on the third, which teleports her to the dungeon entrance with the minion. she quickly goes back through the dungeon, with freebird aiding her flight past the chain devil. the monkeys step on the fourth tile, which plays all star. they step on the fifth, which casts a spell, knocking casia out.

freebird grabs her, jumps the sixth tile, and heals her. the two continue, only stepping on every third tile. navigating this way, they turn some corners until casia lands on a greasy tile and falls, which is a good way for her to learn that the ground is safe again. the monkeys enter a room with skeletons sitting around a good old game of dnd. casia picks up the d12 and rolls it, teleporting her to a demiplane from which there is no escape. freebird, now alone, gathers up all the dice and leaves the room, where they find the grease is actually an oblex. while freebird cannot be harmed due to the gauntlets of true invincibility, the oblex still drains all their memory before freebird manages to kill it. in a daze, they wander into a maze of mirrors, which is on the other side of the invisible wall. they get lost and go the wrong way several times before running into a mirror duplicate of themself. due to their gauntlets, they kill it in a very long battle. they finally find the right way, but start going down an infinite spiral. they turn around, and enter the door to the chamber in which acererak resides. acererak has spells that can bypass the gauntlets of true invincibility. in desperation, freebird throws all of the dice at acererak, instantly converting him into a mimic, which freebird easily dispatches. they roll the d12 and get teleported outside the dungeon. of course, a few days later, they die from the disease and the world ends anyway.

## Intermission 28.5𝛿: Return to Greenest

the party awakes in some beds. intraparty conflict resumes as normal. the party has no recollection of how they got to where they are, but knows that some days have passed. they begin to look around the strange locale in which they find themselves. they encounter a strange woman, who introduces herself as noctis and congratulates the party. she claims that the party has been asleep for three days and in that time she has freed herself and built the location on rock and roll and tiamat's power. she takes them to the bound tiamat, who gives the dreamers vague warnings. noctis then shows the party doog in a new cave. she offers to add a vault to the place and the party does a teambuilding exercise. they travel to the material plane and wake up in the forest near gade's castle. gade is in no mood for talking but the gkc catches him up regardless. gade returns to his sex and the party returns to the banshee cave to investigate before returning to their original task of returning to greenest, which they do. they find smithers' door and stab it open to find a young girl. its name is louise and apparently smithers and mary have adopted it. david gives it his broken shortsword and smithers a golden cup. the party sits down to break fast with the family and tells them about their adventures without actually giving any specific details. just then, a letter arrives from mathers instructing the party to read it at dinner. aaaron tries to understand what mathers was thinking and promptly goes insane, so freebird magically puts him to sleep. they and david split up, with david following smithers to work and freebird going on their own errands.

david buys potions for a high price and meets an adventurer tracking a dwarven criminal and his wife before answering a call for help. aaaron, having recovered from his insanity and subsequent nap, hallucinates being attacked by demons and shadows. he returns to the smithers home and closely studies the letter before coming to the shocking conclusion that it should perhaps be read at dinner. freebird fails to find a bank and calls the post to find that the child has not been delivered. they give the solid gold fiddle to the blind bowyer and encounter a dye seller, who they hire to dye bileth's suit. while they wait, freebird buys some spell components and goes to tell the governor of the removed threat of the cult of tiamat. they pay a visit to the temple of chauntea to ask her for aid but obviously get no response and buy adventuring equipment. they pick up the suit, newly purpled, and head out to the former location of the rearguard of the cult. there, freebird digs a grave for the cult members the party has murdered and mourns them. they return to the temple to attempt to summon their familiar but are interrupted by a high-strung priest, who accuses freebird of summoning devils and calls for help. david answers the call only to find freebird having placed the illusion of a devil in the priest's mind, making him look rather delusional indeed. david and freebird egress without altercation and return to smithers', where aaaron shares his startling revelation. after a refreshing dinner of mostly harmless stew and a quick sharing of stories, aaaron opens the letter, which contains a ring of invisibility and teleports the party away before they can finish reading.

## Chapter 29𝛿: Lore Dump

titania tells the party she cannot personally help them and transports them to the shadowfell. dionysus welcomes them and informs them they've messed up in a major way. he warns the party that most evil gods want them dead and most good gods want them tried, with the exception of himself and mathers. aaaron tries to lie about the gkc's reasons for killing tiamat but dionysus wants none of it. he forces freebird to name noctis with an ultimatum. he then tells the party lore. immortals aren't capable of killing other immortals, but mortals are (temporarily), so long as they have immortal aid. divine magic comes from beings such as gods or monks, while arcane magic comes from the stars. after killing tiamat and becoming the gods' most wanted, the party would have been erased from existence immediately had mathers and dionysus not hidden them. noctis, also known as discordia, the goddess of chaos, freed herself using tiamat's power (she did tell us as much) and engaged dionysus and hermes in combat. dionysus is also protecting the party from discordia's listening. his lore delivered, dionysus introduces the crew, which consists of three hags and one magnanimous mister mathers. he asks the party for a favor. aaaron calls a team meating and expresses his severe distrust. david refuses to listen because dionysus offered to claim doog from discordia's possession. freebird agrees with aaaron's distrust but wants to work against discordia regardless. outnumbered, aaaron decides to postpone the vote until after completing the "favor". david punches mathers. freebird talks to the hags, who are strange. mathers asks the "favor", which is to retrieve dionysus's "dog", refuses to elaborate, and leaves. the party talks to the hags again and are given a finger, a pinecone, and a blessing and told to be wary of alice. the party heads north, following the pointing of the finger, and aaaron swears that if the "dog" is actually a dog, he'll eat the dog.

four more arrive and laugh hideously. david and aaaron chip away at them, allowing freebird to shatter them all. the party then moves on through the field, avoiding and jumping over the swaths of dangerous red flowers. finally, they arrive at a cottage the finger points to with probably the dog in it. unfortunately, the door is magically locked, presenting only a strange pocketwatch-like mechanism. again. in the front garden, a reflection pool stands next to a pillar with a key shaped indent. by turning the knob on the mechanism, aaaron lines the sun up such that its light reflects on the indent, generating the key to the door. inside, a burbling freezes david while aaaron and freebird find a vorpal sword, some cutlery (for dog eating), and the dog, caged. david unfreezes and picks it up. a jabberwocky appears and tears the cottage to shreds. unfortunately, an analysis of the pinecone reveals the jabberwocky's vulnerability to the vorpal sword, which is buried in the rubble of the cottage. aaaron begins searching, as freebird turns him invisible and aids him in avoiding the monster's attacks. david rages and climbs on it, but it dislodges him. freebird recognises the pinecone as a jabberwocky egg as aaaron retrieves the vorpal sword. with the vorpal sword and a bout of luck, aaaron and david deal major damage to the jabberwocky. freebird distracts it with the egg, allowing aaaron to perform the coup de grace and decapitate it. revel, who had disappeared, reappears. the egg hatches into a new baby jabberwocky, which runs off to go ravish the ecosystem. david tries to grab the dog, but it's too slippery. after debate, the party realises that revel will follow them. it teleports over the flowers, revealing its true nature as a blink dog. david does have to carry it across the river, as the ferry is out of service on the authority of the red queen. the party discusses the red queen as they return the dog to dionysus. mathers arrives and the party sits for a war council.
